# nct6795-fancontrol
Fan control GUI for NCT6795 Chip. This project is a practicing project for interacting with sysfs and to learn python-GTK.

Chip used for this project is NCT6795 which is found in following motherboards (help to extend this list):
- MSI Gaming PRO MAX X470

This fancontrol app is possible to work also with other monitoring chips using the same [nct6775](https://github.com/torvalds/linux/blob/master/drivers/hwmon/nct6775.c) driver, though there is no possibility for me to test these.
